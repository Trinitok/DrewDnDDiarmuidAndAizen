        <h1>Importance to the Campaign</h1>
        <p>Diarmuid is pivotal to the campaign.  The players are not supposed to trust, or at least hate/despise, most of the other leadership in the kingdom for being racist.  General Diarmuid is supposed to be the exact opposite.  He is supposed to be the person the party can come to and find weapons and armor for cheaper prices than those in Central City (potentially free) because he does not want them discriminated on by the vendors in Central.  He is in love with Grainne, even though her love may not be genuinely returned.  This is because of his half release which is constantly active.  It is a love spot on his cheek.  Whenever females come into view of him, they must make a CHAR DC17 saving throw or else be attracted to him.  When the party first meets him, he will send them on a quest to quell rebelions in his region that are being incited by a sorceress.  He will send his lieutenant and a squad of soldiers with them on the mission.  The party may shop or explore town, but will be subject to prices due to racism from the shopkeepers.  If they ask Diarmuid directly for weapons/armor/etc. he will supply it for a reduced price (consult GM for reduced prices).  Diarmuid is very loyal to King Arturia because she made him a general even though he is an elf.  He has also gained much prestige with his troops, but some still look down on him for not being human.  He has reservations on the extermination of Ishval, and knows that it has caused a lot of diplomatic issues between Amestris and the Elf Kingdom, but knows that King Arturia is doing the best for the people.  He has the utmost assurance that whatever the outcome, Arturia will be the one to lead Amestris to victory.  After the party reports back from his first mission, he will send them out to investigate a lord's mannor that is mentioned on a map found at the scene of rogue elves during the last mission.  This map will say that there are several hideouts being used all over his domain.  Diarmuid will send the party to one of the many lord's mentioned on the map.  After that quest has been completed, the party can return to Diarmuid, but they will be sent back to Arturia.</p>
        <br />
        <p>It is important to note that Diarmuid is a Holy Servant generated by the Dragon Maximillion who controls all the magic in Amestris and is the source for the ability to use transmutation circles.  Because of this, in order to stay alive, Diarmuid must comply with Maximillion.  Because of this, he is aware of the plot to wipe out all of Amestris in order to summon the holy grail and allow for Maximillion to regain his immortality.  He knows to follow Arturia because she is, more or less, the eyes, ears, and mouth of Maximillion.  She is the strongest of the holy servants summoned by Maximillion.  He is to trick the party into a false sense of security.  He wants to be as friendly as possible to the party so that when they confront Maximillion, he will give the illusion that he will aid them.  Secretly, he will have plans to betray them.  His plan is to betray them during their final confrontation when he will have the most support available from other generals, potentially his military forces, as well as Maximillion himself.  He is to be vanquished by either the players or his lieutenant, Aizen.</p>
