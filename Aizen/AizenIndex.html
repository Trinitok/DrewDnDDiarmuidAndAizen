        <h1>Importance to the Campaign</h1>
        <p>
            Lieutenant Aizen will only serve as a support character in the first campaign.  I have not figured out where he will come in, but he will not be featured often (I don't think.  I have not plannned ahead far enough to be certain).  He is the lieutenant of General Diarmuid who he respects publicly, but is privately waiting for an opportunity to sieze power.  He will play a larger role in the second campaign as the main enemy if we ever get that far.  Unlike most lieutenants, he has unlocked both his half and full soul release.  This puts him on par with many generals in terms of ability.  His capability with the sword is also unparalleled.  He is unaware of the plot to destroy Amestris even though he spends the majority of his time around Diarmuid.  He is aware of Diarmuid's feelings for Grainne and is always looking for an opportunity to exploit them in order to kill and usurp Diarmuid without losing any faith from the people or military.  He will first meet the party when the party is sent on the first quest to find the elves that are under the control of the mysterious sorceress.  If the party asks him any questions, he will give short, polite, to the point replies.  If they ask his opinion of Diarmuid or any other leadership, he will say that he has the utmost respect for them.  If they ask whether they can learn anything from him, he will politely decline and suggest going to Diarmuid.  If the party asks about the extermination of Ishval, he will say that he supports the king's decision to exterminate the weak.  Before charging into the cave with the party and soldiers, he will lie to the party and use his half release to hypnotize the party.  He will say that his half release is as far as he has learned and that his particular half release controls water.  He will quickly hypnotize the party with his sword, and then utilize his full release to make it appear as if he is summoning and controling water out of nowhere.  He and his soldiers will become separated from the party during the battle.

            During the final confrontation with Maximillion, Aizen will fight Diarmuid and vanquish him.  He will do so by revealing his ability to Diarmuid and killing him quickly.
